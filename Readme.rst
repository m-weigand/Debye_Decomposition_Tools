**This repository is not actively maintained anymore. Please refer to the

for updated versions!**

Python implementation of the Debye decompositions routines used to analyse
electrical complex resistivity (or conductivity) spectra as produced by
Spectral Induced Polarisation (SIP) measurements.

The code is licenced under the GPL-3 licence (see corresponding `LICENCE`
file).

Features:

* variable input formats: resistivity or conductivity; magnitude/phase or
  real/imaginary part
* resistivity and conductivity formulations implemented
* for resistivity: Cole-Cole decomposition, whose value of c can be chosen
  between 0 und 1.

Please refer to the Readme files `Readme_linux.txt` and `Readme_windows.txt`
for more information on installation and usage.
